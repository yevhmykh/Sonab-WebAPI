# Sonab (Web API)

This is project doesn't make some usefull work. :smirk:
It's just example of my code. I used nickname generator to create its name. :wink:

## But what it do? :question:

This is some kind of forum with posts and some other staff... I think... I hope... :relieved:

## What interesting here?

Auth0, background jobs, SignalR.

## How to run it?

Some Auth0 functionality requires sensitive data, but I will not attach this data to repository. So if you want to run it follow next steps:
1. Create an Auth0 account
2. Create a new API and a new machine to machine application with 'read:user' permision to managment API(Don't worry. It's free :wink:)
3. Set credentials in configuration or docker-compose file. Now you can start...
