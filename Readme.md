# Sonab (Web API)

This is project doesn't make some usefull work. :smirk:
It's just example of my code. I used nickname generator to create its name. :wink:

## But what it do? :question:

This is some kind of forum with posts and some other staff... I think... I hope... :relieved:

## What interesting here?

Auth0, background jobs.

## How to run it?

You should use ready docker image, because some Auth0 functionality requires sensitive data, but I will not attach this data to repository. 

## License
